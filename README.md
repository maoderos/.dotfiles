# .dotfiles

These are a few files that I use to configure my desktop. 

You can simply get those files and put manually in your computer, or use the script `setup_dotfiles.sh` to create symbolic links in the default configuration paths using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

The script works because the dotfiles are stored in the same way as in your home computer.
